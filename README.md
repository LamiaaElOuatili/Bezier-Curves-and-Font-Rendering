# B√©zier Curves and Font Rendering in C++

## Project Overview   
The goal of this project is to design a **C++ program** that generates glyphs corresponding to uppercase letters of the alphabet in three distinct styles:  

1. **Black outline**  
2. **Filled + Bold**  
3. **Red outline**  

Rendering is implemented using the **SDL2 library**.    

## What are B√©zier Curves?  
B√©zier curves are **mathematical curves** widely used in **computer graphics, design, and typography**. They were introduced by the French engineer **Pierre B√©zier** in the 1960s for car body design at Renault.  

- A B√©zier curve is defined by a set of **control points**:  
  - **Linear B√©zier curve** ‚Üí a straight line between 2 points.  
  - **Quadratic B√©zier curve** ‚Üí defined by 3 points (two endpoints and one control point).  
  - **Cubic B√©zier curve** ‚Üí defined by 4 points (two endpoints and two control points).

- The curve‚Äôs shape is influenced by its control points but only passes through the **endpoints**.  

- They are computed using the **De Casteljau algorithm**, which relies on repeated **linear interpolation** until the curve is fully defined.  

B√©zier curves are the foundation of **vector graphics, TrueType fonts, and scalable digital typography**, since they allow smooth scaling without pixelation. 

## Features of the program
- Implementation of **B√©zier curves** (linear, quadratic, and generic) using the **De Casteljau algorithm**.  
- Object-oriented design with modular, maintainable code.  
- Glyph generation for **all uppercase letters of the alphabet**.  
- Three rendering styles:  
  - üñ§ Black outline  
  - üñ§ Filled with a **bold** version displayed side by side  
  - ‚ù§Ô∏è Red outline  


## Design & Architecture  

### B√©zier Curves  
- **Linear curves** ‚Üí Straight segments between two points.  
- **Quadratic curves** ‚Üí Defined by three points (two endpoints + one control point).  
- **De Casteljau algorithm** ‚Üí Iterative linear interpolation between control points until sufficient precision is reached.  

### Glyphs  
- Each uppercase letter is defined by one or more B√©zier curves.  
- Example:  
  - **A** = two slanted segments + one horizontal bar.  
  - **O** = approximated with four quadratic B√©zier curves forming an ellipse.  



### Compilation  
```bash
g++ -g -Wall -Wextra -o prog *.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl2)
